1) Open Folder: APIDatabase and restore database file: db.bak onto any Microsoft SQL server instance. I used localDB for testing purposes.
2) If needed there are Database queries located in APIDatabase\DBQueries which can be used to create individual tables in the database.
3) Update the file "DBConnectionString" with your SQL server instance name and the name of the database that was restored on the step 1 above.
4) the folder APIService contains the Visual Studio project which can be compiled and rebuilt if needed. 
5) navigate to : \APIService\bin\Debug\net6.0 and paste the file "DBConnectionString" in here then run the file "APIService.exe". 
6) the API service runs on HTTPS port 5000
7) POSTMAN queries are saved in file "DTAPI.postman_collection.json".You can import them in POSTMAN to try out the APIs
